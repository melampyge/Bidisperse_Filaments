A set of data analysis tools to analyse the collective motion of filaments/polymers with bimodal length distributions.

Over the course of my PhD, I have written a ton of such analysis tools. This is an attempt to combine all of them in a package aimed at the general analysis of polymers with a polydisperse (i.e. changing number of beads) length distribution. 

The end product will be controlled over C++ with occasional Python usage via Boost::Python.
